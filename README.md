# 02_calender_db  

my second project: i want to design my own calender app and i am going to start by creating a sqlite database with my contacts, their birthdays and their location.

what am i going to do? 
---  
- create a database 
- add tables
- add relations
- add some testdata
- geocode the locations
- create some views ()
- create some python-funktions to add, search, delete datasets  
- preparing the database for other dates (no it is better to implement it from the beginning)

next projects
---
- a notebook to visualise the data
- a flask dashboard with visualisations of my events (also in maps)
